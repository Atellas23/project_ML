Guidelines to reproduce our results:

1. Data Exploration

Execute in a R enviorement: wine_preprocessing.R

Everything is automatic.
Then, you will see all the graphics (histograms, biplots, ...) that appear in the document and even more.
There is also the part where the duplicated rows has been detected.


2. Project Models

Execute in a R enviorement: wine_project.R

Everything is almost automatic, some changes can be made. 
For example, there are chunks that are commented because we didn't use them at all.
There are also intervals or sequences that there is only the last version we did because is the best approach.
